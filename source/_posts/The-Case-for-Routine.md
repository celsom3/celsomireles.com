When I was young and stupid, I used to think routine was horrible. Now, that I'm not as young and slightly less stupid, I'm starting to see the value in routine.

## But Routine is So Boring!

This was my thought while in College. It was easy to believe that then. Especially as life thrust me into the social justice/non-profit world where routines are myth.

But, I had the energy for it. I thrived on the hectic schedules.

We need to plan an action in DC? Book me the flights and I'm there.

There's a group in Florida planning mass civil disobedience and we need to help them for a few weeks? I'm all for it, I can live out of my suitcase for that long.

This was my life after college, for a good 4 years. Long story short: I burned out, and decided to pursuit something I felt passionate about, unrelated to my immigration status.

The change of pace was welcome, but it wasn't enough. Something was still wrong. I didn't know how to set routine. I was trying to live the same way, with chaos, uncertainty, lack of structure.

Once I realized this, the solution seemed simple:

## Schedule Everything!

NOTE: I should add a screenshot here of what my calendar looked like.

It was *a bit* much.

I scheduled **everything**:

* Getting up
* Morning meditation
* Prepping Gym bag
* Prepping food
* Commute to Gym
* Gym
* Shower
* Commute to office
* ...work stuff
* Commute home
* Dinner
* Reading
* Power Down Routine
* Sleep

Any deviation from this strict regimen resulted in me feeling massively annoyed with myself, and I'm sure with those around me. Not good.

I fell into the trap of too much routine. I suppose either extreme can be problematic.

Currently, I live somewhere in the middle. I have stuff on my calendar, but it's flexible. I consider it a *best case scenario* day. I do have some **non-negotiable**, which I learned from [Marie Forleo](https://youtu.be/1acrUAxFVaw).

## Finding Balance

Now I find myself needing to recommit to some non-negotiables. My morning routine has suffered, mainly because my routine still hasn't recovered from a move and new job. So here's what I'm thinking for my non-negotiables:

* Morning meditation
* Some sort of physical exercise (Hello 7 minute workout)
* Reading/Journal (I do these together)
* Shower

Four things isn't too much right?

If you are one of the few that made it this far, I'd like to know from you:
