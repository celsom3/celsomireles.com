## Context

This is me this morning riding the motorcyle to work:

Celso 1.0

> What time is it?

Celso 2.0

> Well, it's... wait, I'm riding a motorcycle, let me make sure the coast is clear.
> ...
> Wait, why am I even checking what time it is?

Celso 1.0

> You need to know if you're running late or not?

Celso 2.0

> Well, if I'm running late, how is that going to change my behavior?

Celso 1.0

> You will have to speed; weave in and out of traffic.

Celso 2.0

> Why do I have to do that?

Celso 1.0

> Well, you have to get to work on time, don't you?

Celso 2.0

> Yes, but it's a little too late to make any difference in that. If I really wanted to not be in a rush, I would just leave home earlier.

Celso 1.0

> Yeah, well, you did need to fill the gas tank....

Celso 2.0

> Excuses, excuses. The fact is, it is too late to do anything about the time I will get to work. The best time to have an effect on that was earlier this morning, but I decided to not wake up in time for the gym, right?

Celso 1.0

> Ok, ok, but you can still get to work earlier if you just speed up a little.

Celso 2.0

> Well, let's look at the opportunity cost here. How crucial is getting on time to work today? Am I on the verge of losing my job if I get there a few minuted late?

Celso 1.0

> Well not really. You usually make it early and leave late. Today IS an exception.

Celso 2.0

> And do I have a meeting I would be late to?

Celso 1.0

> No.

Celso 2.0

> And, now, what is the cost I would be paying by speeding up and weaving in and out of traffic?

Celso 1.0

> Well, you are significantly risking an accident (thereby your life). You could also get a traffic ticket. There *have* been lot's of people pulled over in this area lately.

Celso 2.0

> Ok, so for saving maybe a minute or two in my commute time, I would be paying the risk of a ticket and my life. Does that sound like a fair price to pay?

Celso 1.0

> I guess not.

Celso 2.0

> Nice. Glad that's settled. Now I'm still stuck in this situation of getting to work a few minutes late. Instead of speeding, what can I do differently next time?

Celso 1.0

> Well, I can stick to your morning routine; wake up early, go to the gym, shower, breakfast, and get to work. I do get to work early when I stick to doing all that.

Celso 2.0

> It's settled then. That's what I need to do to not be in this situation again.
